      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        As a seasoned Sales Business Manager, I bring extensive experience in client relationship management, strategic account planning, and solution development to drive business growth and deliver value-driven outcomes. With a strong technical foundation in Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering and a proven track record managing diverse client portfolios, I excel at identifying growth opportunities, building strategic partnerships, and fostering long-term relationships that support sustainable success.

Since moving to Denmark, I’ve been actively expanding my horizons — learning Danish, volunteering at community events, and engaging in networking activities to better understand the local culture and business environment. These experiences have strengthened my adaptability, intercultural communication, and ability to connect with people from different backgrounds.

My core skills and competencies include:

Strategic Account Management & Key Client Retention
B2B & B2C Sales Strategy
Business Development & Market Expansion
Solution Selling & Consultative Sales
Negotiation & Contract Management
Customer Success & Experience Optimization
Cross-Functional Leadership & Collaboration
Data-Driven Decision Making & Performance Analysis
Project Management & Process Improvement
CRM Tools (Salesforce, HubSpot) & Pipeline Management
Intercultural Communication & Team Engagement

I’m passionate about leveraging my global experience, technical insight, and people-centric approach to create meaningful business impact, exceed client expectations, and contribute to organizational growth.
